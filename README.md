### 2014 ###
Jan,20 Exciting news update. TheGuardian has gracefully agreed to review the code base with a view to bringing in his improvements into the new UI. All going well this branch will hopefully include
- Twitter notifications
- magasine search
- improved configurations
- optimised UI workflow to the Herman-Rodgers UI

And a shout out to nncrypted for bring forth changes and enhancement patches also.

Thanks folks, because I was going cross-eyed trying to bring in the huge volume of changes you both have added to the original branch over a new UI.


To all other contributors - Patches are gratefully received espically when they can be auto merged :).

Thanks - DobyTang

#### LazyLibrarian
LazyLibrarian is a program to follow authors and grab metadata for all your digital reading needs. 
It uses Goodreads.com (for author info and book info) websites as a source. License: GNU GPL v3 

Right now its capable of the following:  
* Find authors and add them to the database  
* List all books of an author and add them as 'wanted'.  
* LazyLibrarian will search a nzb-file for that book (only Newznab and nzbmatrix are currently supported)  
* If a nzb is found it will be send to sabnzbd or saved in a blackhole where your downloadapp can pick it up.  
* When processing the downloaded books it will save a coverpicture (if available) and save all metadata into metadata.opf next to the bookfile (calibre compatible format)
* The new theme for the site allows it to be accessed (and usable) from devices with a smaller screen (such as an iPad)
* AutoAdd feature for book management tools like Calibre which must have books in flattened directory structure
* Added Usenet Crawler configuration + 2 NZB configurations (alas NZBMatrix is gone and removed)
